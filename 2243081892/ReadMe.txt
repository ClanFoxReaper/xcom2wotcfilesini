[h1][b]OVERVIEW[/b][/h1]
This mod expands the vanilla feature of gaining XCom Ability Points for killing powerful enemies.

You can configure which enemies reward AP upon death and how much AP they reward.

AP will be rewarded to the XCom pool to make it consistent with the vanilla events and because bringing down a powerful foe is generally a team effort.

If the Resistance Order "Trial By Fire" is enabled, AP rewards will be adjusted.

For reference, these are the vanilla events that grant additional AP:
[list]
	[*]Killing a Chosen: +5 Ability Points
	[*]Defeating a Chosen: +10 Ability Points
	[*]Ruler Escaped: +2 Ability Points
	[*]Defeating a Ruler: +8 Ability Points
	[*]Defeating Julian: +15 Ability Points
[/list]

[h1][b]CONFIGURATION[/b][/h1]
The configuration file should be in the following location:
[code]<Your Steam Install>
\steamapps\workshop\content\268500\2243081892\Config\XComAPFarming.ini[/code]

By default, the following entries had been added:
[list]
	[*]Defeating a Sectopod: +2 Ability Points

If you want to add a custom enemy, you have two options:
[list]

	(this option will enable the feature for everyone using the mod)
[/list]
